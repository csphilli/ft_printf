# ft_printf
## About

ft_printf is our own version of the standard library's printf. We must replicate the outcome to mirror printf. Some of the new challenges we face when writing this code are the following:
* Becoming familiar with and using variadic functions.
* Implementing various parsing functions that will parse the input string and obtain the different format specifiers and respective modifiers for those values.
* Becoming even more organized with our code. Since we are limited to 25 lines per function, and no more than 5 functions per file, it becomes very important to remain organized so that we do not confuse ourselves about our own program.
* With the various tests available online for this program, we are becoming more cognizant about our code's speed.

## Personal thoughts about the project

This program really challenged me. Up until this point I had done the Piscine Reloaded, Libft, fillit and Init. Most people progress fully down the Init > Roger Skyline 1 > Docker path to grab up the "easy" points. I decided to get the Init done which would push me over level three and satisfy the black hole requirement. But after doing Init I realized that the path wasn't really sparking much interest and I wanted to challenge myself more with C. So I decided on this program. It took a lot out of me. My dad passed away during this program and I lost nearly a month's time programming due to traveling back to the US for the funeral. After returning I really had to dig deep to keep progressing on it. It took longer than normal which I suppose is understandable given the circumstances but I am proud of what I accomplished. Later on I'll likely improve the code as I become more skilled in logic.

At the time of this writing, I currently have 2 evaluations done and am awaiting the 3rd. They've passed with flying colors. The school is closed until June 1st 2020 due to the Corona virus so I'll get the final one done sometime after that and submit it for grading.
